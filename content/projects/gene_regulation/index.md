title: Gene Regulation
summary: Chromatin remodelers are large, multi-subunit complexes that can be assembled in diverse configurations. We use genome-wide approaches to understand how these complexes locate their genomic targets, what they do once they arrive, and how their assembly is regulated. Our current focus is on the roles of post-translational modifications of non-histone proteins and RNA interactions as key mediators of complex assembly and function.
