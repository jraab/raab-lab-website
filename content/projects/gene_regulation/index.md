title: Gene Regulation
summary: How is composition and assembly of chromatin remodeling complexes regulated? Chromatin remdoeleres are large multi-subunit complexes that can be assembled in a variety of ways. We use genome-wide approaches to understand how thse complexes find their targets in the genome, what they do when the get there, and how complex assembly is regulated. We are currently focusing on the role of post-translational modifications on non-histone proteins and RNA interactions as key mediators of complex assembly and funciton.
