title: Gene Regulation
summary: How is composition and assembly of the SWI/SNF complex regulated? <br> SWI/SNF is the chromatin remodeler that best exemplifies the idea of compositional heterogeneity. More than half of its 12-15 subunits can be filled by mutually exclusive proteins. Despite the many studies on the function of SWI/SNF, considerably fewer have focused on regulation of assembly and composition of the complex. My previous work demonstrated significant context-dependence in SWI/SNF activity, but major questions remain about how this activity is regulated.  My lab has interest in using in-house generated ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data combined with publically available genome wide data sets, such as ENCODE, to determine what different co-factors help to define the targets and function of different forms of the SWI/SNF complex. Additionally mechanisms that may control SWI/SNF composition and function such as post-translational modifications of the complex and the role of RNA in regulating SWI/SNF localization or activity are areas we have ongoing efforts. </br>
