title: Chromatin disruption in liver cancer 
summary: Chromatin regulators are among the most frequently mutated genes in hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. We are interested in how disruption of normal chromatin regulation drives the development of these tumors. We are also exploring new therapeutic strategies targeting the epigenome, using high-throughput CRISPR screens to uncover novel therapeutic avenues.
