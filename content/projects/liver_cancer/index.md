title: Chromatin disruption in liver cancer 
summary: Chromatin regualators are among the most frequent mutations in hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. We are interested in how disruption of normal chromatin regulation gives rise to these tumors. We are also looking for new therapeutic strategies targeting the epignome. We use high throghgput CRISPR screens to uncover new therapeutic avenues.
